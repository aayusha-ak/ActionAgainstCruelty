        Factory farming is a cruel and inhumane practice that affects millions of animals every year.
        It is a system that prioritizes profit over the well-being of animals, leading to severe suffering and exploitation.
        This website aims to raise awareness about the cruelty of factory farming and encourage individuals to take action against it.

          <p>
          The way animals are treated inside factory farms is inhumane. 
          I believe that if you are a living being on this Earth, you should at least have the chance to feel sunlight and touch the grass beneath your feet. 
          Yet many animals in factory farms live their entire lives confined indoors, never seeing the sun or experiencing the outside world. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Can you imagine not knowing anything beyond the dark, crowded indoors? 
          These animals are tortured and mistreated every day - they deserve better. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I am not against eating meat. 
          I am against the cruelty and suffering happening behind the closed doors of factory farms. 
          This is not just an ethical issue - it's a moral one. 
          We must take immediate action to end the abuse and demand a more humane and responsible system.

          Factory farming is the practice of raising large numbers of animals

              <br>
              Broilers are chickens raised specifically for meat production.
              These broilers are kept in confined sheds with no access to sunlight.
              The sheds are not cleaned until the chickens are sent to slaughterhouses, causing the air to become polluted with ammonia.
              This damages the chickens' eyes and respiratory systems.
              The poor air quality can also lead to painful burns on thier legs, chests, and feet.
              Due to the excessive use of growth hormones, the chickens often lie down because their legs cannot support their heavy bodies.
              They also suffer from low energy and fatigue due to thier unnatural growth rate.

              <br>
              <br>
              When it is time to slaughter, the broilers are deprived of food for several hours, causing even more stress and hunger.
              At the slaughterhouse, they are hung upside down and stunned by dipping thier heads into electrified water before thier throats are cut.
              However, some chickens miss the water by raising thier heads due to fear, meaning some are fully conscious when their throats are cut open.

              <br>

              Layers are chickens raised specifically for egg production.
              They are typically kept in cages no larger than a file drawer, leaving them unable to move freely or express natural behaviors. 
              In such unnatural and confined conditions, hens often develop abnormal pecking behaviors, which can lead to aggression and cannibalism. 
              To prevent this, factories burn or cut off part of their beaks - a painful procedure that can result in chronic suffering. 
              Once a hen's egg production declines, usually around 1 to 2 years of age, she is either sent to the slaughterhouse or killed on the farm. 
              In some cases, farms will even starve the hens for up to 14 days to shock their bodies into producing one final round of eggs.

              Pigs
            </h2>
            <p>
              Pigs are put in pens and crates that are arid and uncomfortable, with no access to sunlight.
              Due to the high concentration of waste, the air becomes polluted with ammonia.
              Pigs are highly intelligent animals, so such environmental conditions cause them frustration and stress.
              They begin to develop abnormal behaviors such as biting each other's tails.
              To prevent this, factories cut off the pigs' tails and clip their teeth, often without any pain relief.
              <br>
              <br>
              Female breeding pigs are known as sows.
              During their pregnancy, sows are kept in gestation crates, which are even more confining than regular pens.
              These crates do not have enough space for the pregnant pig to turn around or move freely.
              After giving birth, they are moved to farrowing crates to nurse their piglets, which are just as restrictive.
              Once the piglets are weaned, the sows are sent back to the gestation crates to be re-inseminated.
              If they are no longer able to reproduce, they are sent to the slaughterhouse.

              <br>
              Beef cattle are raised for meat production and are one of the few farm animals that are primarily raised outdoors.
              However, they are still kept in unsuitable environments that lack proper vegetation or pasture. 
              Instead of grazing on grass, many are confined to dry, dusty, or muddy feedlots.
              They are typically fed a diet of corn and soy, which is not natural for their digestive systems.
              This unnatural diet can cause cattle to develop painful stomach ulcers and digestive issues.
              
              <a href = "https://www.aspca.org/protecting-farm-animals/animals-factory-farms" target = "_blank" class = "citation">

              <span class = "animalSubheading">Dairy Cattle</span>
              <br>
              Unlike beef cattle, dairy cattle are often kept indoors.
              They may occasionally have access to outdoor environments, but these are usually poor in quality.
              Many dairy cows are confined in tie stalls, where they are chained in place and unable to move freely.
              Their tails and horns are often removed without any pain relief.

              Dairy cows are also subjected to artificial insemination to ensure a continuous supply of milk.
              Right after giving birth, they are separated from their calves so the milk can be collected for human consumption.
              This separation is traumatic for both the mother and the calf, as it denies them the natural bond they would form in the wild.
              The high demands of milk production often lead to health issues, such as mastitis - a painful infection of the udder.
              When their milk production declines, usually after 3 to 5 years, the cows are sent to the slaughterhouse.

              Fish

            <p>
            Fish are often kept in overcrowded conditions, which causes them to experience stress, injuries, and disease.
            Due to the cramped and unsanitary environment, factoty farms rely heavily on antibiotics and other drugs just to keep the fish alive.
            There are currently no regulations in the U.S. that protect fish from inhumane treatment, so many are slaughtered without being stunned first.
            This means fish are often fully conscious when they are killed, causing unnecessary suffering.
            On farms, fish may be killed by suffocation, freezing, or being slaughtered while still conscious.

            <P>
            Factory farming contributes significantly to climate change.  
            About 14.5% of human-made greenhouse gas emissions are produced by animal agriculture.  
            The largest contributor to these emissions in animal agriculture is the production of corn and soybeans,  
            which are the primary food sources for cattle, pigs, chickens, and other animals raised indoors.  
            Each year, the animal agriculture industry produces about 885 billion pounds of manure.  
            This waste is stored in pits and lagoons, where it releases methane and other harmful gases into the atmosphere.

            <p>
              Factory farming poses significant risks to human health.  
              The waste produced by animals pollutes the air and water with harmful bacteria and chemicals.  
              Communities near factory farms are especially affected, as polluted air is released through ventilation systems and vapors from manure sprayed on fields as fertilizer.  
              Each year, over 12,000 air quality-related deaths in the U.S. are linked to factory farming.  
              Emissions from factory farms, such as ammonia, can cause respiratory issues like asthma and bronchitis.  
              Additionally, long-term exposure to these emissions can lead to chronic health problems, including heart disease, cancer, and stroke.  
              <a href = "https://www.aspca.org/protecting-farm-animals/factory-farming-environment" target = "_blank" class = "citation">

            </h>

            <p>
               In the U.S. alone, factory farms produce about 2 million pounds of manure every minute, which is far more than what the land can naturally absorb.  
               This excess manure is often stored in large lagoons or pits, which can overflow and contaminate nearby water sources.  
               The runoff from these lagoons can carry harmful bacteria and other chemicals into rivers, lakes, and groundwater.  
               This contamination can lead to algal blooms, which harm aquatic life and create dead zones where fish and other marine animals cannot survive.  
               The polluted water is unsafe for rural communities that rely on well water too.
